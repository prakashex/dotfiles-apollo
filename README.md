##### Background : The goal is to keep my hands on the keyboad as much as I can , and reduce the time spent on moving your hands between the keyboad and mouse , for that purpose I am using a window manager instead of a Desktop environment   

##### Configs for different distros are available in different branches with the distro names , as long as you use arch and debian based distros you should be fine , to replicate my setup.

#### Applications

- wm - i3
- bar - polybar
- filemanager - nemo 
- gtk-theme - [dracula](https://draculatheme.com)

- compositor - [picom](https://github.com/pijulius/picom) (pijulius's picom fork)
